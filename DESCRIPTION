Description: Simulates data from a joint longitudinal and survival model. The 
    model can be a univariate (one longitudinal outcome) or a multivariate (more
    than one longitudinal outcome) shared parameter joint model. Each longitudinal 
    outcome is assumed to be modelled using a generalised linear mixed model
    (for which a variety of family and link functions are allowed), and where 
    changes over time can be modelled using either linear, quadratic or cubic 
    effects of time. Population-level (i.e. fixed effects) and/or 
    individual-specific parameters (i.e. random effects) can be specified for 
    each of the time effects). A Weibull distribution is assumed for the 
    baseline hazard in the event submodel. A variety of association structures
    are possible for linking the longitudinal and survival submodels. Baseline
    covariates (one binary and one continuous) are included in each longitudinal
    submodel and in the event submodel.
